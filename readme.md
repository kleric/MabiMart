MabiMart is an online auction site for the free-to-play game Mabinogi. Built to simplify the buying and selling of items in game. Not to mention also gaining some experience developing web applications.

MabiMart is built on top of Laravel (PHP Framework) backend and Bootstrap frontend. So far it's been tons of fun to develop, and hopefully it'll be tons of fun to use :)

## Contributing
If you can see this readme, I figure you should already have permissions to contribute :). Try to keep code clean, simple, and readable. Add comments if some parts get confusing.

### License

The MabiMart site is currently closed source software. But we may consider releasing it under open-source later :)
